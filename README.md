This project displays Spotify statistics for multiple users via Grafana.

It uses PHP Scripts for data collection from the Spotify API and InfluxDB as data storage.

## Setup

1. Copy ``config/*.env.dist`` to ``config/*.env`` and change the credentials
2. Run ``composer install`` in ``php/src`` to make sure vendor exists for volume mount (only dev environment)
3. Run ``docker-compose up -d`` to provision Grafana, InfluxDB and PHP+Nginx
4. Log in to the [Spotify Developer] website
5. Set up a new Spotify App, add the callback URL ``http://localhost:8080/callback.php`` and add client id and client secret to ``php.env``
6. Log in to Grafana and remove the permission "View" on dashboard "Current User" (navigate settings > permissions > click on group "SpotiSights" > remove role "Viewer" from board)


## Data Flow / User setup

1. Admin: add user email to permitted users in your Spotify app
2. User: Call http://localhost:8080/ and follow the displayed auth flow (technical reference: see auth section)
3. User: initial crawl is executed for new users on first successful connection (**pulls max. 50 last listened tracks**)
4. Admin: find username by new session name in file system / username in admin dashboard 
5. Admin: create user with email, username = Spotify username and "Viewer" permissions (default)
6. Cronjob: collects recent tracks fron the authorized user and saves them to InfluxDB (**interval defined in docker-cron**)
7. User: Log in to Grafana at http://localhost:3000/ and navigate to the Dashboard "spotisights" (http://localhost:3000/?orgId=1&search=open)
8. User: There should be a dashboard called "Current User" whch only shows data for the current user

## Auth

This app implements the [Authorization Code Flow] of Spotify with [Refresh Tokens] by using file sessions.

### API Scopes

| scope                     | reason                           | api endpoint         |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------|
| user-read-recently-played | used for statistic collection    | getMyRecentTracks()  |
| user-read-private         | used for reading username        | me()                 |
| user-read-email           | currently not used, but required | me()                 |


## Disclaimer ARM CPUs (code: see branch "arm")

While there are alternatives for each image and building / running them on linux/amd64 will work with minor adjustments
building and running them on ARM is problematic. 

In any case the image ``mendhak/arm32v6-influxdb`` isn't a 1:1 replacement and you have to manually create the database
after startup or write a script for that.

You also have to start crond manually due to using the user "nobody" during runtime:

    crond -b -L /docker.stdout

### linux/arm/v6

Grafana is only compatible with linux/armv7, the container will not start.

### linux/arm/v7

Despite Grafana now working the php container will not start due to one of the following errors:

```
dns for composer resolution will fail, even when adding the dns server directly to the docker daemon config
```

```
php_1       | Fatal Python error: init_interp_main: can't initialize time
php_1       | Python runtime state: core initialized
php_1       | PermissionError: [Errno 1] Operation not permitted
php_1       |
php_1       | Current thread 0x76f87390 (most recent call first):
php_1       | <no Python frame>
```

This most likely has to do with libseccomp2 not being compatible.

**I stopped debugging and used a system with a linux/amd64 CPU.**
